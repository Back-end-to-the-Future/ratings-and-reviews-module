Day 5 of SDC

From the last time I wrote an entry until now, I have chosen my two databases, I have created schemas for both databases, and now I have a data generating script for my reviews table. I chose to go down the route of using pgAdmin. pgAdmin makes creating databases, schemas, and tables really simple once you figure out the basics. It took me a few tutorials and a video to really understand what I needed to do but overall once you learn the few things that you need in order to move forward, the time spent goes by quickly.

I also found, for the visualization aspects of creating my schema theres a website that is pretty amazing, along with a few others that I checked out, and I chose it to create my tables which solified my understanding of how all of this is going to come together in terms of the relationships between certain aspects of data.

For connecting my database to my repo, I ended up consulting a couple of different resources. One was the official docs for postegres/Node and the other was a video that Andre shared. Both really came in handy.

As far as data generation is concerned, Zachary helped me out tremendously by providing a couple of different resources that were key in helping me understand a little bit about how to go about it. He also helped me get the ball rolling with the actual js files for them by explaining his logic. I'm happy about what I've got so far, however I'm open to the possibility that I might have to rewrite them in case there are any issues with bunching or something else unpredictable.

For fake data generation, I used Faker. Pretty straight forward. Their API is actually extensive and easy to understand.

My plan is to continue to write the rest of the data generating script files, and then write out my queries to my DB. Once I do that, I'll seed my db with just a few records in order to test my queries out. After that, I'm off to the races.
