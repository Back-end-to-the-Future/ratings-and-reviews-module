Day 2 of the SDC.

I just finished all of the preliminary steps I needed to take before I dive into picking my first database for this project.

What I have done so far:
  1.) Started for part of the Scaling the Database step.
    - support CRUD from your API
    - Dumy data: I ended up using Postman with the previous API to copy and paste that data into a file. I exported each object and required them in my server.
